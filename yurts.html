                    <h3>What is a yurt?</h3>
                        <p>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures 
                            four feet off the ground. Each yurt has canvas 
                            walls, a wooden floor, a roof dome that can be 
                            opened, and a private deck.</p>

                    <h3>How are the yurts furnished?</h3>
                        <p>Each yurt is furnished with a gas fireplace, 
                            king-size bed with down quilt, comfy couch, dining table 
                            and chairs, mini-fridge, microwave, and coffee maker.

                    <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
                        <p>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to 
                            dress for changing weather with light layers of clothing. 
                            It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!</p>
